In this lesson, weâ€™re going to learn how to get input from the user using the input() function. With this function, users can interact with the program by typing into the console.

input() is a function that outputs a message, often referred to as a prompt, pauses the program and waits for the user to type something in the console. When the user presses Enter, the input they typed is returned as a string. When a function does its job, it often gives back a result. This result is called the return value. The return value may be saved to a variable or used in some other expression.

#Example:
favorite_color = input("Enter your favorite color: ")
print("Your favorite color is ", favorite_color)

#Output:
Enter your favorite color: 
red
Your favorite color is red
