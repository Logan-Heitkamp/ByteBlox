We can use loops to iterate through elements of an list. The key is to access each item, one at a time. We do this by tracking what index we are currently at using a number variable. A common convention is to use a variable named i to track the index.

#Example:
print("--- Sodas App ---")

soda_list = []
soda_number = 1

# Let user add 5 sodas to the list
while soda_number <= 5:
    soda_list.append(input("Add a soda to your list: "))
    soda_number += 1

i = 0 # Use i to access the list indexes dynamically

# Show sodas in a list
print("\nHere are your sodas:")

# len(soda_list) returns the number of elements in the list
while i < len(soda_list):
    print(f"- {soda_list[i]}")
    i += 1
