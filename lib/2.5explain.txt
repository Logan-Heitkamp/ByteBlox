It is not uncommon for a program to run a set of instructions repeatedly. Programming languages all provide some construct for repeatedly executing a set of statements. These are known as loops.

There are a few different ways to repeat code. For Python developers, the first construct to learn is known as the while loop.

While loops look similar to if statements in that they have a keyword, a condition, and an associated code block. However, a while loop while repeatedly execute as long as the specified condition is true. That means somewhere in the loop, there needs to be a statement that will change the condition to evaluate to false.


#Example:
number = 10

# Keep executing loop while number is greater than 0
while number > 0:
    print(f"Number is {number}")
    number = number - 1
