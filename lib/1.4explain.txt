Variables allow us to store data during our programâ€™s execution. You use the equal sign (=) to assign a value to a variable. Here, you can both declare and assign a value in one line, which is known as initialization. Python handles data types like strings, integers, and floats seamlessly. Python uses dynamic typing, which means the data type a variable stores can change during runtime.

#Example:
number1 = 10
number2 = 400
sum = number1 + number2
print(f"The sum is {sum}")

#Output:
The sum is 410


Variable Scope
Variable scope refers to where a variable can be accessed in your code. For example, the program below will raise an error because number1 must be declared before it can be used.

# Error
print(number1)
number1 = 5
