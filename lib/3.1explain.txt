Something that can store many items in a collection are called data structures. One of the fundamental data structures is the list.

Lists can store multiple values in a single structure.
Items in a list are referred to as elements.
Elements of a list are retrieved by referencing their position, or their order in the list.

#Example:
wallet1 = ["Johnny", 1000]
wallet2 = ["Francis", 2.55]
wallet3 = ["Adam", -10]

print(f"{wallet1[0]}'s bank balance: ${wallet1[1]}")
print(f"{wallet2[0]}'s bank balance: ${wallet2[1]}")
print(f"{wallet3[0]}'s bank balance: ${wallet3[1]}")
