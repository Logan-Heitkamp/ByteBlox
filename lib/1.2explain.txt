In Python, we don’t just use math to crunch numbers; we also use it to display results to users. The print() function helps us with this—it can output text messages, numbers, and the results of math expressions.

Integers and Floats

Python, like many other programming languages, differentiates between whole numbers and decimal numbers. Whole numbers are called integers, while decimal numbers are referred to as floats (or floating-point numbers). This distinction is crucial for handling arithmetic operations accurately.

Math Operators

+ Addition: Adds two numbers together.
- Subtraction: Subtracts one number from another.
* Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
/ Division: Divides one number by another and returns the quotient as a decimal.
% Modulus (aka mod): Returns the remainder after division.

Examples:

# Multiplication
print("I'm 30 years old. In months, that's: ") # Replace 30 with your age
print(30 * 12) # Replace 30 with your age
print()

# Output
I'm 30 years old. In months, that's: 360



# Remainder using the modulus, or mod, operator
print("After dividing $100 among 6 people, the leftover cents are:")
print(100 % 6)
print()

#Output
After dividing $100 among 6 people, the leftover cents are: 4
