Although while loops are capable of iterating through lists, there are other JavaScript constructs that make the process easier. For example, there is a specific kind of loop called a for loop whose purpose is to iterate, or loop, through elements in a collection.

#Example:
fruits = ['apples', 'bananas', 'cherries', 'dates']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

#Output:
apples
bananas
cherries
dates
